    Authentication : Authnext.js
    Internationalization (i18) : bulit in support next-i18next

    Server-side caching : cache-control header  (built in support for server side caching), we can also use Redis or Memcached to cache API or db queries

    Dynamic imports : basically lazy loading the component whenever possible like heavy components, third-party libraries and conditional loading.
        this helps in auto code splitting, ssR, fallback (loaders)
