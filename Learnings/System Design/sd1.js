    System Design:
    It is the process of identifying, creating, and designing systems that meet a company’s or organization’s specific objectives and expectations. 
    Systems design is more about system analysis, architectural patterns, APIs, design patterns, and glueing it all together than it is about coding.

    


    CAP Theorem:
    C : Consistency => consistent data , results
    A : Availability => DB, server, 
    P : Partition Tolerance => 



    Horizontal Scaling: (increasing similar systems)
    1. adding more similar systems to partition the load (load balancers)
    2. Increases system availability, capacity, scalability




    Vertical Scaling: (increasing processing power)
    1. more processing ability, single source 
    2.
