    Load balancers:
    Distributing the workload between two or more servers.
    Active - pasive : server A moves to server B only when it reaches certain point (server running as a backup for performance or worst case conditions)
    Active - Active : Actively divides traffic between the servers
    Round Robin : distributes traffic in round robin fashion
    IP Hash : uses IP hashes to transfer traffic between the servers
    weighted Round robin : round robin but some servers has extra preference or extra processing power
    Least Connection : server with least traffic will get more at that specific time
    Geographical : connecting some geogrpahical servers to some specific server to transfer the load and reduce the latency.

    existing tech tools : HAProxy, NGINX, Appache HTTP Server, Amazon ELB
