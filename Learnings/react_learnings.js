// Higher order components

/*
    A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

    What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs) in React, and how can they be used? Are there any alternatives to HOCs in modern React?
        Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are a design pattern in React that allows the reuse of component logic by wrapping components with a function.
        HOCs take a component and return a new enhanced component with additional features or behaviors. 

    Alternates to HOC:
        direct renders
        Hooks
